# Multiple PDF Query Chat using LlamaIndex

This project demonstrates how to build a chat application that can query information from multiple PDF documents using LlamaIndex.  LlamaIndex simplifies the process of connecting your data (in this case, PDFs) to large language models (LLMs), enabling you to create powerful question-answering and chat applications.

## Overview

This application allows users to ask questions about the content within a collection of PDF files.  LlamaIndex handles the complexities of indexing the PDF data, creating embeddings, and retrieving relevant information to provide accurate and contextually appropriate responses to user queries.

## Features

* **Multiple PDF Support:**  Handles querying across multiple PDF documents.
* **Chat Interface:**  Provides a conversational chat interface for interacting with the PDF data.
* **Contextual Responses:**  Leverages LlamaIndex to provide contextually relevant answers based on the PDF content.
* **Easy Integration:**  Simplifies the process of connecting PDFs to LLMs for querying.  *(Mention the specific LLM used, if applicable.)*

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **LlamaIndex:**  The core library for indexing and querying data.
* **LangChain:** *(If used)* For chain of thought prompting or other LLM workflows.
* **[Other Libraries]:** List any other Python libraries used (e.g., `PyPDF2`, `tiktoken`, etc.).
* **[LLM Used]:** Specify the LLM used (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face models, etc.).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have a compatible Python version installed.
* **Required Libraries:** Install the necessary Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install llamaindex langchain [other libraries]
LLM API Key: You'll need an API key for the LLM you're using. (Provide instructions on how to obtain the API key.)
Installation
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/Parasuram19/Multiple_PDF_Query-Chat_using_LlamaIndex.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dhttps://github.com/Parasuram19/Multiple_PDF_Query-Chat_using_LlamaIndex.git)
Navigate to the Directory:

Bash

cd Multiple_PDF_Query-Chat_using_LlamaIndex
Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
# OR install individually as shown above
Running the Application
Place PDF Files: Place the PDF files you want to query in the designated directory. (Specify the directory name and path.)

Set API Key: Set your LLM API key as an environment variable or within the code. (Provide specific instructions on how to do this.)

Run the Script:

Bash

python app.py  # Replace app.py with the name of your main script
Interact with the Chat: Follow the instructions in the terminal to interact with the chat interface and ask questions about your PDFs.

Usage
Prepare PDFs: Make sure your PDF files are in the correct directory.
Run the app: Execute the Python script.
Ask Questions: Type your questions in the chat prompt and press Enter.
Receive Answers: The application will process your query and provide an answer based on the content of the PDFs.
Example
You: What is the main topic discussed in the PDFs?
Bot: The PDFs discuss [summarized topic].
